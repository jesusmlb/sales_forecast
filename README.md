# **Demand Forecast**

This project explores a dataset of 3,059 products to predict sales over an 8-week period. The goal is to apply and compare different approaches to demand forecasting, providing insights into univariate and multivariate time series modelling.

---

## **Notebook Workflow**
The analysis follows these steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Preparing the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2. **Data Processing**  
   Formatting and transforming the data for time series analysis, including feature engineering and scaling.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualizing trends, seasonality, and relationships within the data to derive key insights.

4. **Modeling**  
   - Training individual time series models (univariate) for each product.  
   - Implementing and comparing results with multivariate time series models.

5. **Recommendations**  
   Sharing insights and strategies for improving demand forecasting.

## **Future Improvements**
While this analysis lays the groundwork for effective demand forecasting, further enhancements are planned:
- Incorporating external factors (e.g., weather) to improve model accuracy.  
- Testing advanced modelling techniques, such as stacking models.  
- Automating feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
